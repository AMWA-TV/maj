# Media Authoring with Java API (MAJ)

The MAJ API is a pure Java API for creating, reading, manipulating and writing MXF (SMPTE 0377), [AAF](http://www.amwa.tv/projects/MS-01.shtml) and Reg-XML (SMPTE 2001) files. MXF files are commonly used are a container for professional media file formats and AAF is supported by a number of professional video editing packages. MXF and Reg-XML are used as part of the [Interoperable Mastering Format](http://www.imfforum.com/IMF_Forum/index.html) suite of specifications.

This is a stable version of the API that is in use in production environments. Contributions to improve the API are welcome, particularly to ensure that the code remains up-to-date with evolving specifications and metadata dictionaries.
