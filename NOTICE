Media Authoring with Java API (MAJ)
Copyright 2007-2016 Richard Cartwright

This API includes software developed with the support of Snell Advanced
Media (http://www.s-a-m.com/).

Portions of this software were developed with reference to the AAF SDK. Any
similarities between this API and the AAF SDK are not intentional although may
occur where structures are similar between the languages.
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/aaf/)

Bug fixes and the maven build process were made possible with the help of
Guillaume Belrose and Fang Ren.

The author is thankful for the help and support he received from staff at the BBC,
AMWA and Metaglue Corporation.
