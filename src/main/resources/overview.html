<title>MAJ API Overview</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="white">

<p>This documentation describes the <em>Media Authoring with Java API</em>
(MAJ API), some generic <em>media industry</em> and an implementation of the classes of the Advanced Authoring Format
specification in Java. The media industry is a general purpose library code for making and manipulating structures
defined according to <a href="http://www.smpte-ra.org">SMPTE registers</a>. The AAF classes are implemented
as plain old Java objects (POJOs) and that can be mapped to EJB3-style persistent entities.</p>

<p>This API provides the basis for applications that capture. edit, manage and distribute media
according to professional standards. The API provides support for AAF, MXF and Reg-XML file formats.
It provides extensions mechanism to allow implementors to extend the core classes to meet new
standards or represent private data. This API is being developed as a project of the
<a href="http://www.amwa.tv">Advanced Media Workflow Association</a> and is licensed
under the Apache 2.0 License. Note, however, that support for manipulating essence
with MAJ is currently very limited.</p>

<p>The documentation of all the packages is rich and complete, so worthwhile exploring for a technical person. In
particular, {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.industry.MediaEngine media engine},
{@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.industry.Forge forge}, and {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.industry.Warehouse warehouse}
are at the heart of the API's capabilities, so it is a good place to start exploring.</p>

<p>This page provides some getting started topics:</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="scratch">Writing code from scratch</h2>

<p>An application can be written using the AAF data model from scratch without the need to read
or write files. One difference between MAJ and the AAF SDK is that you can write code that uses
classes of the AAF model without the need to contain them within a virtual file at runtime. For more
details, see the documentation of the <a href="tv/amwa/maj/industry/package-summary.html">industry
package</a>.</p>

<p>The starting point is to initialize the local Java virtual machine so that it supports
processing the AAF data model with {@link tv.amwa.maj.industry.MediaEngine#initializeAAF() MediaEngine.initializeAAF()}.
You can then start creating objects of the AAF data model, including
{@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.model.Package packages}, {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.model.Track tracks},
{@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.model.Sequence sequences} and {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.model.SourceClip source clips},
using the <em>make...</em> methods of the @linkplain tv.amwa.maj.industry.Forge forge}, for example
{@link tv.amwa.maj.industry.Forge#make(Class, Object...) make(Class, Object...)}.</p>

<p>Every class in MAJ provides a registered XML representation as its <code>toString()</code>
output, which in turn is created by
{@link tv.amwa.maj.industry.MediaEngine#toString(tv.amwa.maj.industry.MetadataObject) MediaEngine.toString(MetadataObject)}.
This make debugging fairly easy as you can query a value in the debugger and see a human-readable XML format.</p>

<p>To help you get started, here is a {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.example.AMWADemoClass code example}:</p>

<pre>
package tv.amwa.maj.example;

import tv.amwa.maj.industry.Forge;
import tv.amwa.maj.industry.MediaEngine;
import tv.amwa.maj.model.*;

public class AMWADemoClass
    implements tv.amwa.maj.constant.CommonConstants {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        MediaEngine.initializeAAF(); // Required to initialize AAF specified classes

        MaterialPackage amwaPackage = Forge.makeByName(
                AAF_XML_NAMESPACE, "MaterialPackage",
                "PackageID", Forge.randomUMID(), // Randomly generated
                "Name", "AMWADemoPackage",
                "PackageLastModified", Forge.now(),
                "CreationTime", Forge.now());

        Sequence amwaVideoSequence = Forge.makeByName(
                AAF_XML_NAMESPACE, "Sequence",
                "ComponentDataDefinition", "Picture");

        amwaVideoSequence.appendComponentObject(
                Forge.make(
                        SourceClip.class,
                        "ComponentDataDefinition", "Picture",
                        "ComponentLength", 60l,
                        "SourcePackageID", "urn:smpte:umid:060c2b34.02051101.01001000.13000000.11ee08d4.040311d4.8e3d0090.27dfca7c",
                        "SourceTrackID", 1,
                        "StartPosition", 10l));

        TimelineTrack amwaVideoTrack = Forge.make(
                TimelineTrack.class,
                "TrackID", 1,
                "TrackSegment", amwaVideoSequence,
                "EditRate", "25/1",
                "Origin", 0l);

        amwaVideoTrack.setTrackName("AMWA VIDEO TRACK");

        amwaPackage.appendPackageTrack(amwaVideoTrack);
        amwaPackage.appendPackageUserComment("company", "portability 4 media");

        System.out.println(amwaPackage.toString());
    }
}
</pre>

<p>For a more complex example, see the source for the {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.example.CompositionExample composition
example} that is part of the AMWA training course.</p>

<h2 id="aaf-klv">MXF files - AAF-KLV</h2>

<p>MXF files, also known as AAF-KLV files, consist of sequence of partitions. Partitions contain
a partition header and may contain metadata, index tables and/or essence data. Support for reading
and writing MXF files is provided in package
<code><a href="tv/amwa/maj/io/mxf/package-summary.html">tv.amwa.maj.io.mxf</a></code>.</p>

<h3>Reading MXF partitions</h3>

<p>MXF files contain one or more partitions. The first step in reading an MXF file is to build an
in memory cache of the structure of those partitions. To do this:</p>

<pre>
import tv.amwa.maj.industry.MediaEngine;
import tv.amwa.maj.io.mxf.MXFFactory;
import tv.amwa.maj.io.mxf.MXFFile;

...

  MXFFile mxfFile = MXFFactory.readPartitions("filename.mxf");
</pre>

<p>All MXF files contain a header partition. Most also contain a footer partition. To access these:</p>

<pre>
import tv.amwa.maj.io.mxf.HeaderPartition;
import tv.amwa.maj.io.mxf.FooterPartition;

...

  HeaderPartition header = mxfFile.getHeaderPartition();
  FooterPartition footer = mxfFile.getFooterPartition();
</pre>

<h3>Reading header metadata</h3>

<p>Partitions can contain header metadata and this is split into a primer pack and a preface.
The metadata can be read into memory from file using the readHeaderMetadata() method.</p>

<p>If a footer partition is present in an MXF file and it contains header metadata, this version
is often the most trusted source for metadata about the file as it was written once the rest of the
file is complete. If the footer partition is not present or does not contain header metadata, read
the header partition's header metadata.</p>

<pre>
import tv.amwa.maj.model.Preface;
import tv.amwa.maj.io.mxf.HeaderMetadata;

...

  HeaderMetadata headerMD = null;
  if ((footer != null) && (footer.hasHeaderMetadata())
    headerMD = footer.readHeaderMetadata();
  else
    headerMD = header.readHeaderMetadata();

  Preface preface = headerMD.getPreface();
</pre>

<p>Methods from the preface interface can be used to interrogate what is in the MXF file, or you
can call <code>toString()</code> on the preface to get an XML representation.</p>

<h3>Writing header metadata</h3>

<p>This code is still in development, but it will take the form of an application altering an
existing preface, setting it to replace that within existing header metadata and calling a write method.
Well structured MXF should have padding at the end of the existing metadata, allowing the existing
metadata to be overwritten and extended. Writing will fail if insufficient padding space is available.</p>

<h3>Reading the index table</h3>

<p>An index table maps edit unit indexes to stream offsets in essence containers. This enables the data
representing a specific frame of video or audio sample to be located in the file, for example to generate
a still frame or carry out a partial restore. Any <em>long GOP</em> structure used to store the essence can also be
interrogated to work out a safe point to break a file, e.g. don't forget the previous I-frame!</p>

<p>Any partition may have an index table. To read the index table and find the stream offset to the 10th
frame 2nd element, measured in bytes from the beginning of its essence container, use ...</p>

<pre>
import tv.amwa.maj.io.mxf.IndexTable;

...

  IndexTable index = footer.readIndexTable();
  long tenthFrameOffset = index.streamOffset(10, 2);
</pre>

<p>Note that in interleaved streams, the element number determines whether it is an edit unit worth of
video, audio or data track being referred to. You need to know your stream layout to insert the correct
element number.</p>

<h2 id="aaf-ss">AAF files - AAF-SS</h2>

<p>AAF files, also known as AAF-SS or AAF structured storage files, store AAF structured data in a Microsoft
structured storage container. To read and write these files, MAJ uses the
<a href="http://poi.apache.org/download.html#POI-3.7">Apache POI library version 3.7</a>.</p>

<p>Support for reading
and writing AAF files is provided in package
<code><a href="tv/amwa/maj/io/aaf/package-summary.html">tv.amwa.maj.io.aaf</a></code>. MAJ provides a
helper class {@link tv.amwa.maj.io.aaf.AAFFactory AAFFactory} as a starting point for reading and writing
AAF files.</p>

<h3>Reading a preface from an AAF file</h3>

<p>To read a preface from an AAF file, such as those generated by Avid, use the
{@link tv.amwa.maj.io.aaf.AAFFactory AAFFactory#readPreface(java.lang.String) readPreface()} method
of the {@link tv.amwa.maj.io.aaf.AAFFactory AAFFactory} class. For example:</p>

<pre>
import tv.amwa.maj.io.aaf.AAFFactory;
import tv.amwa.maj.iface.Preface;
import tv.amwa.maj.extensions.avid.AvidFactory;
...

AvidFactory.registerAvidExtensions();
Preface fromAAF = AAFFactory.readPreface("filename.aaf");
</pre>

<p>Some warning messages will be printed if extensions are unknown. These can be ignored unless the extension
data is important to your application.</p>

<h3>Writing a metadata-only AAF file</h3>

<p>MAJ supports writing metadata-only AAF files, files that do not contain any essence data.
AAF is commonly used as a metadata-only representation so this limitation means MAJ still works in many
use cases.</p>

<p>To write an existing preface to an AAF file, make sure the Avid extensions are registered (as for
reading) and use the
{@link tv.amwa.maj.io.aaf.AAFFactory AAFFactory#writePreface(tv.amwa.maj.model.Preface, java.lang.String) writePreface()}
method of the {@link tv.amwa.maj.io.aaf.AAFFactory AAFFactory} class.</p>

<pre>
import tv.amwa.maj.io.AAFFactory;
import tv.amwa.maj.iface.Preface;
...

Preface prefaceToWrite = ...;
AAFFactory.writePreface(prefaceToWrite, "filename.aaf");
</pre>

<p>MAJ will create a dynamic meta dictionary and, if the preface does not contain a valid dictionary
already, add in all the required definitions to make the file valid.</p>

<h2 id="aaf-xml">Reg-XML files - AAF-XML</h2>

<p>AAF XML files are also known as registered data XML files (SMPTE draft standard 2001). MAJ uses
this format for the return value of <code>toString()</code> methods almost everywhere, so it is easy to get to learn
this format. When you use a debugger and hover over a variable that is a MAJ type, you will see the same XML format.</p>

<p>Support for reading
and writing XML files is provided in package
<code><a href="tv/amwa/maj/io/xml/package-summary.html">tv.amwa.maj.io.xml</a></code>. MAJ provides a helper
class {@link tv.amwa.maj.io.xml.XMLBuilder XMLBuilder} as a starting point for reading and writing
AAF fragments to and from XML.</p>

<p>The methods the serialize objects to and from XML are useful for providing RESTful and web service
interfaces to an AAF-based repository. Reading and writing complete files allows XML to be used in
file-based workflows in place of the harder-to-analyse MXF and AAF formats.</p>

<h3>Serializing an object to XML fragments</h3>

<p>To convert a single object and any of its contained strong referenced objects to XML, use method
{@link tv.amwa.maj.io.xml.XMLBuilder#toXML(tv.amwa.maj.industry.MetadataObject) toXML()} methods
of the {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.io.xml.XMLBuilder XML builder}.</p>

<pre>
import tv.amwa.maj.io.xml.XMLBuilder;
import tv.amwa.maj.iface.MaterialPackage;
...

MaterialPackage material = ...;
String packageAsXML = XMLBuilder.toXML(material);
</pre>

<p>Any objects that implement {@link tv.amwa.maj.io.xml.XMLSerializable XMLSerializable} or
{@link tv.amwa.maj.industry.MetadataObject MetadataObject} can be serialized to XML fragments.</p>

<h3>Creating objects from an XML fragment</h3>

<p>To read the XML representation of an object in XML and create an instance in memory,
use either the {@link tv.amwa.maj.io.xml.XMLBuilder#createFromXML(InputSource) createFromXML()} or
{@link tv.amwa.maj.io.xml.XMLBuilder#createFromXMLString(String) createFromXMLString()} methods of the
{@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.io.xml.XMLBuilder XML builder}.</p>

<pre>
import tv.amwa.maj.io.xml.XMLBuilder;
import tv.amwa.maj.iface.MaterialPackage;
...

MaterialPackage material =
        (MaterialPackage) XMLBulder.createFromXMLString(packageAsXML);
</pre>

<h3>Reading complete Reg XML files with MAJ</h3>

<p>Complete XML files have a root <code>&lt;AAF&gt;</code> root element.
To read a preface from an XML file, register all the required data types and then
use the {@link tv.amwa.maj.io.xml.XMLFactory#readPreface(String) readPreface()}
static method of the {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.io.xml.XMLFactory XML factory}.</p>

<pre>
import tv.amwa.maj.io.xml.XMLFactory;
import tv.amwa.maj.model.Preface;
....

Preface preface = XMLFactory.readPreface("input_file.xml");
</pre>

<p>Catch {@linkplain java.io.IOException IO exceptions} to find out about any problems
parsing the XML.</p>

<p>Note that the automatic processing of extension metadata that is not registered
with MAJ is not supported in the current version of the MAJ API.</p>

<h3>Writing complete Reg XML files with MAJ</h3>

<p>Complete XML files have a root <code>&lt;AAF&gt;</code> root element.
To write a complete Reg XML file, use the
{@link tv.amwa.maj.io.xml.XMLFactory#writePreface(tv.amwa.maj.model.Preface, String) writePreface()} static method
of the {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.io.xml.XMLFactory XML factory}.</p>

<pre>
import tv.amwa.maj.io.xml.XMLFactory;
....

XMLFactory.writePreface(preface, "output_file.xml");
</pre>

<p>The {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.model.Preface preface} will be automatically updated with a correct
{@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.model.Dictionary dictionary} and any extensions classes will
be added to the output. Note that an application is expected to have added an appropriate
{@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.model.Identification identification} to the preface to identify the
current version of the file before calling this method.</p>

<h2 id="extensions">Extensions</h2>

<p>Writing extensions, for example to represent your companies descriptive metadata scheme, can be
achieved by writing Java interfaces and classes that represent those extensions. How to do this
is described in the <a href="tv/amwa/maj/industry/package-summary.html">industry package</a> and
in particular in the description of the {@link tv.amwa.maj.industry.MediaClass MediaClass} and
{@link tv.amwa.maj.industry.MediaProperty MediaProperty} annotations. In fact, if you have some
existing Java beans, annotating them to work as media classes with MAJ may be quite simple.</p>

<p>If writing all that Java is a scary thought, MAJ provides an
{@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.util.AutoGeneration auto generator} that can take
an XML description of metadata extensions and create Java package sourcecode that can be
compiled and used with MAJ.</p>

<p>Some Avid Media Composer extensions are provided in package
<code><a href="tv/amwa/maj/extensions/avid/package-summary.html">tv.amwa.maj.extensions.avid</a></code>.</p>

<h2 id="advanced">Advanced features</h2>

<p>MAJ provides a means for {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.industry.JPAGenerator generating Java Persistence API
compatible object-relational mappings} from its own internal representation of media classes.</p>

<p>MAJ can generate an XML representation of classes, properties and types that it knows about
using static method MediaEngine.generateMetaDictionary().</p> <!-- TODO add a link in this comment -->
