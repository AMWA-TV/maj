<p>Provides annotations that describe the mapping of miscellaneous 
AAF data types to Java data types. These annotations are designed to assist
a developer by providing additional information about to interprete a value
over and above the value's generic type definition.</p>

<h2>Annotation usage</h2>

<p>These annotations are primarily used to label methods in the <a href="../iface/package-summary.html">MAJ
API interfaces package</a> and <a href="../record/package-summary.html">record packages</a>. For example, 
the get and set methods for the video line map property of a {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.model.PictureDescriptor picture
descriptor} are:</p>

<pre>
    public @VideoLineMap int[] getVideoLineMap();
</pre>

<pre>
    public void setVideoLineMap(@VideoLineMap int[] videoLineMap)
        throws NullPointerException;
</pre>

<p>These annotations are provided for source code use only and are not available 
via the Java reflection API at runtime.</p>

<h2>Heritage</h2>

<p>These annotations are derived from a combination of:</p>

<ul>
 <li>the renamed type definitions of the standard AAF meta dictionary;</li>
 <li>type name aliases defined in the <a href="http://aaf.sourceforge.net/">C-based 
 AAF SDK</a> in file "<code>AAFTypes.h</code>".
</ul>

<p>To look up the Java type used to represent a C data type in the AAF SDK, or 
vice versa, use the utility {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.util.LookupTable type lookup table}.</p>
