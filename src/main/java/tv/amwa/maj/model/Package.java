 * $Log: Package.java,v $
 * Revision 1.3  2011/02/14 22:32:49  vizigoth
 * First commit after major sourceforge outage.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2011/01/13 17:44:26  vizigoth
 * Major refactor of the industrial area and improved front-end documentation.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2011/01/04 10:39:03  vizigoth
 * Refactor all package names to simpler forms more consistent with typical Java usage.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2010/02/10 23:43:22  vizigoth
 * Improvements to create and mod time method names to match meta dictionary.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2009/05/14 16:15:12  vizigoth
 * Major refactor to remove dependency on JPA and introduce better interface and implementation separation. Removed all setPropertiesFromInterface and castFromInterface methods.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2009/03/30 09:04:50  vizigoth
 * Refactor to use SMPTE harmonized names and add early KLV file support.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2008/10/16 16:51:53  vizigoth
 * First early release 0.1.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2008/02/28 12:50:35  vizigoth
 * Minor comment edits and fixes.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2008/02/08 11:27:19  vizigoth
 * Edited comments to a release standard and minor comment fixes.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2008/01/14 21:05:37  vizigoth
 * Minor change due to refactoring of Depend enumeration.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2007/12/04 13:04:50  vizigoth
