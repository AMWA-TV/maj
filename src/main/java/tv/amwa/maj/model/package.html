<p>Specifications of all the interchangeable classes of AAF as Java interfaces. The root class
for all interchangeable classes that can be serialized to an AAF file is
{@link tv.amwa.maj.model.InterchangeObject}.  </p>

<h2 id="heritage">Heritage</h2>

<p>The interfaces in this package were derived from the COM API provided with the
C++ reference implementation for AAF in file "<code>AAF.idl</code>". This COM API
provides a set of public interfaces to AAF classes that map well to Java interfaces,
with the benefit that the translated interfaces will have a similar names and support
similar implementation patterns to those of the reference implementation. This will be an advantage
in the event that any existing C-based code using the reference implementation is ported
to Java.</p>

<p>This section describes issues that were encountered in the translation of the
interfaces and methods from the COM API into Java interfaces. These include a different
approach to exceptional conditions, representation of optional properties, enumerators
over collections and default values.</p>

<h3 id="comInterfaces">Derivation from COM interfaces</h3>

<p>The file "<code>AAF.idl</code>" in the C-based AAF reference implementation contains
the specifications of a number of interfaces and their associated methods. These interfaces
cover all of the classes of the AAF object specification, including meta definitions.
Additional interfaces are also specified relating to file handling and, where appropriate,
these have been included in the MAJ API. Where the standard Java API provides built-in
features duplicated in the COM interfaces, the Java approach is chosen in preference.</p>

<p>In general, each interface in "<code>AAF.idl</code>" maps to a public Java interface in this
package. Due to Java rules constraining one public interface to be defined in one file, this
means that the single file in the existing reference implementation has mapped to 117&nbsp;files
in the MAJ API! An interface named <code>IAAFMob</code> becomes {@link tv.amwa.maj.model.Package} in the
MAJ API. Translation of the material object (mob) interface, now called <em>package</em> under the
SMPTE unified names for AAF and MXF, will now be used as an example
of how interfaces have been translated from the COM API into the MAJ API.</p>

<h4 id="ifaceTranslation">Interface translation</h4>

<p>For each interface in the COM API, documentation refers to a number of independent
interfaces that must be additionally implemented by any implementation of the interface to
achieve the AAF class hierarchy. This approach could have been adopted in the MAJ API but no automatic
compiler checking would take place to ensure all the required methods were provided in any implementation.
Instead, the MAJ API uses interface inheritance. For the mob example, the COM API documentation
says that all all mobs must also implement <code>IAAFObject</code>. In the MAJ API, this interface is
known by its specified name of {@link tv.amwa.maj.model.InterchangeObject} and the mob/package interface
extends this.</p>

<pre>
    public interface Package
        extends InterchangeObject {

            ...
    }
</pre>

<p>When the COM API is extended to support new features, extra interfaces are added. In
the case of a mob, new methods have been specified in interface <code>IAAFMob2</code>.
These extended interfaces have been merged into one interface in the MAJ API, meaning that
all the methods of interface <code>IAAFMob2</code> from the COM API are included in interface
{@link tv.amwa.maj.model.Package} in the MAJ API.</p>

<h4 id="basicMethodTranslation">Basic method translation</h4>

<p>Every mob has a mob&nbsp;id property with get and set methods that allow that property to
be set in both the COM API and MAJ API. These methods are specified in the COM API as
follows:</p>

<pre>
    HRESULT GetMobID (
        [out] aafMobID_t *  pMobID);

    HRESULT SetMobID (
        [in, ref] aafMobID_constref  mobID);
</pre>

<p>In the MAJ API, the new MXF and AAF SMPTE harmonized names are used, so a <em>MobID</em> is now
known as a <em>PackageID</em>. Therefore, the above methods translate to the following equivalents
in the MAJ API:</p>

<pre>
    public &#64;PackageIDType tv.amwa.maj.record.PackageID getPackageID();

    public void setPackageID(
            &#64;PackageIDType tv.amwa.maj.record.PackageID packageID)
        throws NullPointerException;
</pre>

<p>The steps taken in the method translation illustrated by the code
above are as follows:</p>

<ul>
 <li>All method names start with a lower case letter in the MAJ API. In most
 cases, this is the only change made to a method name between the COM API and
 the MAJ API. In the example, <code>GetMobID</code> becomes <code>getPackageID</code>.</li>

 <li>If a method has a single <em>out</em> parameter in the COM API, this
 becomes the return value of the method in the MAJ API. In the example, the single
 <code>[out]</code> parameter of the <code>GetMobID</code> method is of type
 <code>aafMobID_t&nbsp;*</code>. This type is represented by the interface
 {@link tv.amwa.maj.record.PackageID tv.amwa.maj.record.PackageID} in the MAJ API and
 so a value of this type is returned from method <code>getPackageID</code>. The
 annotation {@link tv.amwa.maj.misctype.PackageIDType &#64;PackageIDType} is included
 to show that the value returned by the method is of "PackageIDType" as specified
 in the AAF object specification.</li>

 <li>The COM API returns a value of type "<code>HRESULT</code>" from every method.
 This is a 4-byte integer code as defined by a set of macros in file "<code>AAFResult.h</code>".
 The successful completion of a COM API method returns result code "<code>AAFRESULT_SUCCESS</code>".
 For the MAJ API, all methods are considered to complete successfully unless they
 throw an {@linkplain java.lang.Exception exception}. This creates the opportunity
 for a MAJ API method to return a value, which is an approach more commonly adopted by
 the Java community.</li>

 <li>All <em>in</em> parameters of a method in the COM API are replaced by equivalent method
 parameters for the MAJ API, using appropriate type mappings. These type mappings can be
 queried through the {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.util.LookupTable type MAJ API lookup table}.
 In the example COM API set method, the <code>mobID</code> method parameter of type
 <code>aafMobID_constref</code> is translated to parameter <code>mobId</code> of type
 {@link tv.amwa.maj.record.PackageID} in the MAJ API.</li>

 <li>The package id property of a package is a required property and so it should not be omitted, ie.
 set to undefined or <code>null</code>. The COM API documentation often includes a list of result codes to
 be returned when the method has not been successful. One of these is
 "<code>AAFRESULT_NULL_PARAM</code>" that indicates that a null value has been
 encountered unexpectedly. In the MAJ API, this translates to the standard
 {@link java.lang.NullPointerException}.</li>

 <li>Finally, the documentation of the COM API method has been used as the basis of
 the MAJ API documentation. However, a lot of subsequent editing has taken place so that
 the MAJ API documentation is often more like the AAF object specification than
 the COM API documentation. For an example, see {@link tv.amwa.maj.model.Package#getPackageID()} and
 {@link tv.amwa.maj.model.Package#setPackageID(tv.amwa.maj.record.PackageID) Mob.setPackageID()}.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="stringMethodTranslation">String property method translation</h4>

<p>String handling is different between the C-based COM API, which uses null-terminated
sequences of <code>aafCharacter_t</code> values, and the MAJ API, which uses the built-in
{@linkplain java.lang.String Java string} class. For the mob interface, the following methods
are defined to set the name of the mob:</p>

<pre>
    HRESULT SetName (
        [in, string] aafCharacter_constptr  pName);

    HRESULT GetNameBufLen (
        [out] aafUInt32 *  pBufSize);

    HRESULT GetName (
        [out, string, size_is(bufSize)] aafCharacter *  pName,
        [in] aafUInt32  bufSize);
</pre>

<p>These three methods translate to the following methods in the {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.model.Package package
interface} of the MAJ API:</p>

<pre>
    public void setName(
        &#64;AAFString String name);

    public &#64;AAFString String getName()
        throws PropertyNotPresentException;
</pre>

<p>The <code>GetNameBufLen</code> method of the COM API is required so that a character buffer of the
appropriate size can be passed to <code>GetName</code>. Java can return a string object without the
need for a buffer to be provided, so a name buffer length method is not required.</p>

<p>The name property is optional for the AAF specified Mob class. If the <code>GetName</code> method
of the COM API is called when the name is not present, a <code>AAFRESULT_PROP_NOT_PRESENT</code> result
code is returned. In the MAJ API, this is replaced by throwing a {@link tv.amwa.maj.exception.PropertyNotPresentException}
exception. Most result codes from the COM API have been translated to Java exceptions, either as
standard Java exceptions or newly created, MAJ API-specific exceptions are described further in the description of the
<a href="../exception/package-summary.html">exception package</a>. Also, see the <a href="#omittedNull">MAJ API
approach to omitted property values</a>.</p>

<h4 id="multipleOutParameters">Multiple out parameters</h4>

<p>Some methods in the COM API have multiple <em>out</em> parameters. Java only supports the return
of one parameter from a method, but this can be an interface to an object with several properties, acting
like a record. Where this is the case, an interface to access multi-parameter return values has been created
in the <a href="../union/package-summary.html">union package</a>.</p>

<p>As an example, consider the following method in the COM API that returns the fade values
of a {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.model.SourceClip source clip}:</p>

<pre>
    HRESULT GetFade (
        [out] aafLength_t *    pFadeInLen,
        [out] aafFadeType_t *  pFadeInType,
        [out] aafBoolean_t *   pFadeInPresent,
        [out] aafLength_t *    pFadeOutLen,
        [out] aafFadeType_t *  pFadeOutType,
        [out] aafBoolean_t *   pFadeOutPresent);
</pre>

<p>This is replaced by the following method in the MAJ API:</p>

<pre>
    public tv.amwa.maj.union.Fade getFade();
</pre>

<p>The {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.union.Fade fade interface} of the MAJ API is specified
to have the following methods:</p>

<pre>
    public interface Fade {

        public &#64;LengthType long getFadeInLength();
        public void setFadeInLength(&#64;LengthType long fadeInLength);

        public FadeType getFadeInType();
        public void setFadeInType(FadeType fadeInType);

        public boolean isFadeInPresent();

        public &#64;LengthType long getFadeOutLength();
        public void setFadeOutLength(&#64;LengthType long fadeOutLength);

        public FadeType getFadeOutType();
        public void setFadeOutType(FadeType fadeOutType);

        public boolean isFadeOutPresent();
    }
</pre>

<h3 id="initialization">Object initialization</h3>

<p>In the COM API, some objects are represented as having a <em>not initialized</em> and
<em>initialized</em> state. The specification of these classes may define an
<code>initialize</code> method, which could return an <em>already initialized</em> result if
the object is already in an initialized state. Also, many methods in the reference implementation
are specified to return a <em>not initialized</em> result to indicate that the object on which they
were called is in the not initialized state.</p>

<p>In the MAJ API interfaces, all objects are considered initialized once they are created, which
greatly simplifies the resulting code and relies on Java's object state management rather than requiring
an implementor to write their own. Therefore, no public mechanism is provided to create a class without
setting its required parameters or accepting default values. Use the factory methods of the
{@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.industry.Forge forge} to do this and take care that any default values
provided are either acceptable as they are or replaced.</p>

<p>Direct access to underlying public constructor methods are not provided.</p>

<h3 id="naming">Naming</h3>

<h4 id="aliasesExpanded">COM API names and Java names</h4>

<p>The COM API uses a number of abbreviations in its names for methods and classes, such as
"Def" for "Definition". As many IDEs for Java offer auto-completion facilities, the approach
adopted for the MAJ API is that names should be as close as possible to full-length English
words. The intention is to make any Java code as readable as possible. The table below shows
some of the expansions:</p>

<center>
<table style="text-align: left">
<thead>
<tr><th>COM API alias</th><th>MAJ API name</th><th>COM API example</th><th>MAJ API equivalent</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Def</td><td>Definition</td><td>OperationDef</td><td>OperationDefinition</td></tr>
<tr><td>Enum</td><td>Enumeration</td><td>TypeDefEnum</td><td>TypeDefinitionEnumeration</td></tr>
<tr><td>Int</td><td>Integer</td><td>TypeDefInt</td><td>TypeDefinitionInteger</td></tr>
<tr><td>Object</td><td>InterchangeObject</td><td>IAAFObject</td><td>InterchangeObject</td></tr>
<tr><td>ObjRef</td><td>ObjectReference</td><td>TypeDefWeakObjectRef</td><td>TypeDefinitionWeakObjectReference</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</center>

<p>Wherever possible, the names used in the MAJ API match those used in AAF object specification.</p>

<h4 id="namingConflicts">Naming conflicts</h4>

<p>Applying the mapping of the film edge code data type in the "<code>AAFTypes.h</code>" to Java
in the same way as other structures would create a Java interface in the MAJ API called <em>Edgecode</em>.
Applying the mapping of COM API interfaces to the existing AAF reference implementation to Java
interfaces would also create an interface called <em>Edgecode</em>. To resolve this naming conflict,
the edgecode structure is mapped to an {@link tv.amwa.maj.record.EdgeCodeValue} and the AAF specified
class becomes {@link tv.amwa.maj.model.EdgeCodeSegment}.</p>

<p>A similar naming conflict has been encountered for <em>Timecode</em>. The timecode structure maps
to a Java interface in the MAJ API called {@link tv.amwa.maj.record.TimecodeValue} and the timecode
interface for the specified AAF class is called {@link tv.amwa.maj.model.TimecodeSegment}.</p>

<p>Another conflict existed between the AAF specified class <em>SourceReference</em> and structure
"<code>aafSourceRef_t</code>". The source reference structure maps to a Java interface in the
MAJ API called {@link tv.amwa.maj.union.SourceReferenceValue} and the source reference
interface for the specified AAF class is called {@link tv.amwa.maj.model.SourceReferenceSegment}.</p>

<p>To avoid conflicts with commonly used Java class names in the Java API, some classes in
the MAJ API have had the letters "AAF" appended to the start of their names or reverted to their
specified names. These include:</p>

<center>
<table style="text-align: left">
<thead>
<tr><th>AAF ref. impl. name</th><th>MAJ API name</th><th>to avoid conflict with</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>File</td>
<td>{@link tv.amwa.maj.model.AAFFile}</td><td>{@link java.io.File java.io.File}</td></tr>
<tr><td>FileDescriptor</td>
<td>{@link tv.amwa.maj.model.AAFFileDescriptor}</td><td>{@link java.io.FileDescriptor java.io.FileDescriptor}</td></tr>
<tr><td>Object</td>
<td>{@link tv.amwa.maj.model.InterchangeObject}</td><td>{@link java.lang.Object java.lang.Object}</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</center>

<h3 id="collections">Representing lists, arrays and sets</h3>

<p>The AAF object specification specifies three data types for the representation of collections:
{@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.meta.TypeDefinitionFixedArray fixed size arrays},
{@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.meta.TypeDefinitionVariableArray variable size arrays} and
{@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.meta.TypeDefinitionSet sets}. Methods of the COM API that allow
access to properties of these types may return type-specific enumerators over
the elements of a collection or pointers to arrays with the size of that array. The
MAJ API approach is different and depends on the type defined for a property.</p>

<h4 id="arrays">Fixed and variable sized arrays</h4>

<p>For arrays of values that are represented in the COM API by an <em>out</em> parameter that is a pointer to
a block of memory containing a sequence of values, such as the {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.model.SourceReferenceSegment#getChannelIDs()
channel ids property of a source reference segment}, the MAJ API returns a Java array. This is
the case for arrays of values of primitive types, such as {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.integer.UInt32}, or
record values, such as {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.record.AUID}.</p>

<p>The following code is the COM API method for retrieving the current value of the channel IDs
property:</p>

<pre>
    HRESULT GetChannelIDs (
        [in] aafUInt32  numberElements,
        [in] aafUInt32*  pChannelIDs);
</pre>

<p>In the MAJ API, this has been translated to:</p>

<pre>
    public &#64;UInt32Array int[] getChannelIDs();
</pre>

<p>For variable size arrays, the COM API also returns a length. This is not necessary in Java as
every Java array is an object with access to its current length through its length field. For
example:</p>

<pre>
    int[] channelIds = mySource.getChannelIDs();
    int channelIdsLength = channelIds.length;
</pre>

<h4>Weak and strong reference vectors</h4>

<p>The data types known as <em>weak reference vectors</em> and <em>strong reference vectors</em>
in the AAF object specification are ordered collections of references to other AAF persistent
objects or meta objects. These are not collections of elements of primitive or record types.
The COM API includes a standard set of methods for manipulating any property of vector type, including
<em>append</em>, <em>insert at</em>, <em>remove at</em> etc., as well as specifying a type-specific enumerator for
ordered access to the elements. In the translation to the MAJ API, the methods are included and the type-specific
enumerators are replaced by the use of the Java generic collections framework {@linkplain java.util.List list type}.</p>

<p>For example, the <code>IEnumAAFMobSlots</code>
interface in the COM API is replaced by the Java <code>java.util.List&lt;? extends Track&gt;</code>
generic list in the MAJ API. The following code shows the COM API methods for managing the list of
{@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.model.Track tracks} of a {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.model.Package package}:</p>

<pre>
    HRESULT AppendSlot (
        [in] IAAFMobSlot * pSlot);
    HRESULT PrependSlot (
        [in] IAAFMobSlot * pSlot);
    HRESULT InsertSlotAt (
        [in] aafUInt32  index,
        [in] IAAFMobSlot * pSlot);
    HRESULT RemoveSlotAt (
        [in] aafUInt32  index);
    HRESULT GetSlotAt (
        [in] aafUInt32  index,
        [out, retval] IAAFMobSlot ** ppSlot);
    HRESULT GetSlots (
        [out] IEnumAAFMobSlots ** ppEnum);
</pre>

<p>MAJ API supports the MXF and AAF SMPTE harmonized names, so an AAF <em>MobSlot</em> is known as a
<em>Track</em>. This translates to the following methods in the MAJ API:</p>

<pre>
    public void appendPackageTrack(
            Track track);
    public void prependPackageTrack(
            Track track);
    public void insertPackageTrackAt(
            int index,
            Track track);
    public void removePackageTrackAt(
            int index);
    public Track getPackageTrackAt(
            int index);
    public java.util.List&lt;? extends Track&gt; getPackageTracks();
</pre>

<h4 id="sets">Weak and strong reference sets</h4>

<p>The data types known as <em>weak reference sets</em> or <em>strong reference sets</em> in the
AAF object specification are unordered collections of references to other AAF persistent
objects or meta objects. These are not collections elements of primitive types or
record values. The COM API includes a standard set of methods for manipulating any property of
set type, including <em>add</em>, <em>count</em> and <em>remove</em> etc., as well as specifying
a type-specific enumerator for access to the elements in no particular order. In
the translation to the MAJ API, the methods are included and the type-specific enumerators are replaced
by the use of the Java generic collections framework {@linkplain java.util.Set set type}.</p>

<p>For example, the <code>IEnumAAFEssenceData</code> interface in the COM API is replaced by the
Java <code>java.util.Set&lt;? extends EssenceData&gt;</code> generic set in the MAJ API. The following
code shows the COM API methods for managing the set of {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.model.EssenceData essence
data items} stored in a {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.model.ContentStorage content storage}:</p>

<pre>
    HRESULT AddEssenceData (
        [in] IAAFEssenceData * pEssenceData);
    HRESULT CountEssenceData (
        [out, retval] aafUInt32 *  pResult);
    HRESULT RemoveEssenceData (
        [in] IAAFEssenceData * pEssenceData);
    HRESULT LookupEssenceData (
        [in, ref] aafMobID_constref  mobID,
        [out,retval] IAAFEssenceData ** ppEssenceData);
    HRESULT EnumEssenceData (
        [out,retval] IEnumAAFEssenceData ** ppEnum);
</pre>

<p>This translates to the following methods in the MAJ API:</p>

<pre>
    public void addEssenceData(
            EssenceData essenceData);
    public &#64;UInt32 int countEssenceData();
    public void removeEssenceData(
            EssenceData essenceData);
    public EssenceData lookupEssenceData(
            tv.amwa.maj.record.PackageID mobId);
    public java.util.Set&lt;? extends EssenceData&gt; enumEssenceData();
</pre>

<h4 id="shallowCopy">Shallow copy of a collection</h4>

<p>The collections returned by methods such as {@link tv.amwa.maj.model.Package#getPackageTracks() Package.getPackageTracks()}
and {@link tv.amwa.maj.model.ContentStorage#enumEssenceDataObjects() ContentStorage.enumEssenceDataObjects()} are
specified to be shallow copies. This means that the actual collection object returned by the
method is not the same as the one stored in the persistent object on which the method was called.
Modifications to the structures of collection returned will not cause any side effects on the stored
collection. However, the elements within the returned collection are not cloned and modifications to
any of the elements will have a side effect on the elements stored within the persistent object owning
the collection.</p>

<p>All MAJ API implementations of the interfaces in this package support cloning, so creating a
deep copy of a collection is possible with code similar to the following example:</p>

<pre>
    Collection&lt;? extends InterchangeObject&gt; group;
    ...
    for ( InterchangeObject item : group ) {
        group.remove(item);
        group.add(item.clone());
    }
</pre>

<p>Although the interfaces of this package specify shallow copies only, an implementation of the
interfaces of this package may return a deep copy of all collections. For reasons of
efficiency, the implementations provided with the MAJ API only return shallow copies of collections.
In general, this is acceptable for the manipulation of a file whereas for the creation of a media asset
management system based on these classes, care needs to be taken when sharing items between
collections.</p>

<h3 id="properties">Optional properties and default values</h3>

<p>A property of an AAF persistent class or meta definition class may be either <em>optional</em> or
<em>required</em>. Required properties shall always provide a value for any instance of their class.
If a property is optional for a class, it may be either <em>present</em> or <em>omitted</em> from
an instance of that class. This makes a lot of sense for efficient serialized representations of AAF objects where
a sequence of bytes representing the instance of a class does not have to contain any bytes for a
particular property. However, for a Java object or an entity persisted to a database in a media asset
management system, it is necessary to provide get and set methods and have a column available to store all
properties. This section describes the MAJ API approach to optional properties.</p>

<h4 id="requiredProperties">Required properties</h4>

<p>Required properties are always considered as present and typically have a pair of get and set methods each,
which work as follows:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The get method of a required property should always return a valid and not null value for that property.
 Most required properties are initialized during the construction of the class.</li>

 <li>The set method of a required property should throw a {@linkplain java.lang.NullPointerException null
 pointer exception} if an attempt is made to set its value to <code>null</code>. The method may throw an
 {@linkplain java.lang.IllegalArgumentException illegal argument exception} if an attempt is made to set
 a value outside of the acceptable range for that property.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#basicMethodTranslation">As discussed earlier</a>, the required
{@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.record.PackageID package id} property's get and set methods
for the {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.model.Package package} class in the COM API:</p>

<pre>
    HRESULT GetMobID (
        [out] aafMobID_t *  pMobID);

    HRESULT SetMobID (
        [in, ref] aafMobID_constref  mobID);
</pre>

<p>The equivalent methods in the MAJ API are:</p>

<pre>
    public &#64;PackageIDType PackageID getPackageID();

    public void setPackageID(
            &#64;PackageIDType PackageID packageID)
        throws NullPointerException;
</pre>

<h4 id="omittedNull">Omitted properties are Java null values</h4>

<p>Java provides the <code>null</code> keyword to allow the value of any object to be interpreted by
an application as undefined or not present. Any optional value within the MAJ API implementation of the interfaces
of this package uses <code>null</code> internally to represent an omitted property value.</p>

<p>The behaviour of the interface methods for optional properties without default values are as follows:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Any get method for an optional property will return the value of that property if it is currently
 present, otherwise it will throw a {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.exception.PropertyNotPresentException property
 not present exception}. Optional property get methods should not return <code>null</code> unless this is
 explicitly permitted in the documentation of the method.</li>

 <li>Any set method for an optional property will allow the value of the property to be set to
 <code>null</code> to omit it, as follows:
 <ul>
  <li>If the method is called with a <code>null</code> value: if the property is currently present it will become
  omitted; if the property is currently omitted then it will remain omitted.</li>
  <li>Calling the method with a not null value will: modify the value of a present property to the given value; make
  an omitted property become present and set it to the given value. The method may throw an
  {@linkplain java.lang.IllegalArgumentException illegal argument exception} if an attempt is made to set a value
  outside of the acceptable range for the property.</li>
 </ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Primitive types in Java, such as <code>int</code> and <code>char</code>, cannot be set to <code>null</code>.
However, each of the primitive types has a corresponding object representation in the <code>java.lang</code>
package, such as {@link java.lang.Integer} and {@link java.lang.Character}, that can be set to <code>null</code>.
Therefore, set methods for optional properties of these types use the object representation as parameters so
the property can be set to be omitted. Java provides auto-boxing and un-boxing of primitive values to/from their
object-representation equivalent types, so there is no need to convert an <code>int</code> value to an
{@link java.lang.Integer} value before calling the set method.</p>

<p>For example, the optional "AudioRefLevel" property of a {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.model.SoundDescriptor sound descriptor} has
no default value and the following get/set methods in the COM API:</p>

<pre>
    HRESULT GetAudioRefLevel (
        [out] aafInt8 *  pLevel);

    HRESULT SetAudioRefLevel (
        [in] aafInt8  level);
</pre>

<p>The get method shown above may return a result of <code>AAFRESULT_PROP_NOT_PRESENT</code>. The equivalent
methods in the MAJ API are:</p>

<pre>
    public &#64;Int8 byte getAudioRefLevel()
        throws PropertyNotPresentException;

    public void setAudioRefLevel(
            &#64;Int8 Byte audioRefLevel);
</pre>

<p>Note that the use of {@link java.lang.Byte} as the type for the parameter for the set method is deliberate to
allow the property to be omitted by setting it to <code>null</code>.</p>

<h4 id="defaultValues">Default values</h4>

<p>Some optional properties have default values specified in the AAF object specification. For these
properties, the interfaces of this package are specified to return the default value if an optional property
is omitted. The default values are specified as constant values in the interface specification containing
the associated optional property. For an {@link tv.amwa.maj.model.RGBADescriptor}, these are:</p>

<ul>
 <li>{@link tv.amwa.maj.model.RGBADescriptor#ALPHAMINREF_DEFAULT} - default value for the "AlphaMinRef"
 property;</li>
 <li>{@link tv.amwa.maj.model.RGBADescriptor#ALPHAMAXREF_DEFAULT} - default value for the "AlphaMaxRef"
 property;</li>
 <li>{@link tv.amwa.maj.model.RGBADescriptor#COMPONENTMINREF_DEFAULT} - default value for the
 "ComponentMinRef" property;</li>
 <li>{@link tv.amwa.maj.model.RGBADescriptor#COMPONENTMAXREF_DEFAULT} - default value for the
 "ComponentMaxRef" property;</li>
 <li>{@link tv.amwa.maj.model.RGBADescriptor#SCANNINGDIRECTION_DEFAULT} - default value for the
 "ScanningDirection" property.</li>
</ul>


<p>The behaviour of the interface methods for optional properties with default values are as follows:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Any get method for an optional property with a default value will return that default value if the property
 is omitted, otherwise it will return the value currently set for the property. The behaviour of this kind
 of method is the same for an omitted property and for a present property that happens to be set to the
 default value.</li>

 <li>Any set method for an optional property with a default value will accept a <code>null</code> value to
 omit the property, as follows:
 <ul>
  <li>If the method is called with a <code>null</code> value: if the property is currently present it will become
  omitted; if the property is currently omitted, it will remain omitted and subsequent calls to the matching get
  method will return the default value of the property.</li>
  <li>Calling the value with a not null value will: modify the value of a present property to the given value; make
  an omitted property become present and set it to the given value. The method may throw an
  {@linkplain java.lang.IllegalArgumentException illegal argument exception} if an attempt is made to set a value
  outside of the acceptable range for the property.</li>
 </ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This approach can make it difficult to find out if a property is present or omitted. Some interfaces
include a <em>is property present</em> method, such as {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.union.Fade#isFadeOutPresent()}.
An alternative approach is to use the
{@link tv.amwa.maj.industry.MediaEngine#isPropertyPresent(tv.amwa.maj.industry.MetadataObject, String) MediaEngine.isPropertyPresent()}
method of every {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.model.InterchangeObject interchange object}. For example,
use the following code to find out if the "AlphaMinRef" property is present for a {@link tv.amwa.maj.model.RGBADescriptor}:</p>

<pre>
    RGBADescriptor imageInfo;
    ...
    ClassDefinition imageInfoClass = imageInfo.getDefinition();
    PropertyDefinition alphaMinRefProperty =
        imageInfoClass.lookupPropertyDefinition("AlphaMinRef");
    boolean alphaMinPresent = imageInfo.isPropertyPresent(alphaMinRefProperty);
</pre>

<p>As an example of an optional property with a default value, here are the methods to set and get the "AlphaMinRef" property
in the COM API:</p>

<pre>
    HRESULT GetAlphaMinRef (
        [out] aafUInt32 *  pAlphaMinRef);

    HRESULT SetAlphaMinRef (
        [in] aafUInt32  alphaMinRef);
</pre>

<p>For the get method, the COM API does not return the default value when the property is omitted. Instead,
it returns an <code>AAFRESULT_PROP_NOT_PRESENT</code> code. In contrast, the following equivalent MAJ
API methods always succeed with the get method returning the default value when the property is
omitted:</p>

<pre>
    public &#64;UInt32 int getAlphaMinRef();

    public void setAlphaMinRef(
            &#64;UInt32 Integer alphaMinRef);
</pre>

<p>The set method can be called with <code>null</code> to omit this property.</p>

<h3 id="optionalCollections">Cardinality and collections</h3>

<p>Some collection properties are optional, some are allowed to be empty. The MAJ API represents
collections of a specified cardinality as shown in the following table:</p>

<center>
<table cellpadding="1em" style="text-align: left">
<thead>
<tr><td></td><th>optional collection</th><th>required collection</th></tr>
</thead>
</tbody>
<tr><th>0..*</th>
<td>Property is omitted when the collection is empty. Property is present
when it contains at least one item. No representation of an empty
collection.</td>
<td>Collection may be empty and present.</td></tr>
<tr><th>1..*</th>
<td>Property is either omitted or the property is present and contains
at least one value.</td>
<td>Property should always contains at least one element.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>This is problematic in the case that an AAF file deliberately represents an
empty collection for a present optional property. The MAJ API makes no distinction
between an empty optional collection property and an omitted optional collection property.
Reading in a file with an empty present collection property will result in an internal
MAJ API representation as a omitted collection property. Subsequent writing of the
same data will omit the property.</p>
