/*
 * $Log: VaryingValue.java,v $
 * Revision 1.2  2011/01/13 17:44:26  vizigoth
 * Major refactor of the industrial area and improved front-end documentation.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2011/01/04 10:39:02  vizigoth
 * Refactor all package names to simpler forms more consistent with typical Java usage.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2009/05/14 16:15:13  vizigoth
 * Major refactor to remove dependency on JPA and introduce better interface and implementation separation. Removed all setPropertiesFromInterface and castFromInterface methods.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2009/03/30 09:04:50  vizigoth
 * Refactor to use SMPTE harmonized names and add early KLV file support.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2008/10/16 16:51:53  vizigoth
 * First early release 0.1.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2008/02/08 11:27:25  vizigoth
 * Edited comments to a release standard and minor comment fixes.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2007/12/04 13:04:52  vizigoth
 * Removed safe collections and proxy handling. The first is not required due to ? extends in interface definitions and the second is not a solution to the shared resources problem.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2007/11/13 22:08:34  vizigoth
 * Public release of MAJ API.
