<p>Implementation of the AAF interchange object classes. The AAF interchange object classes are specified in 
section&nbsp;6 to&nbsp;15 of the <a href="http://www.amwa.tv/html/specs/aafobjectspec-v1.1.pdf">AAF object
specification v1.1</a>. This implementation treats all classes as EJB3 entities that can be 
persisted to a database using an object-relational mapping tool.</p>
