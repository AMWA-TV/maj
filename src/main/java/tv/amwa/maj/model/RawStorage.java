/**
 * <p>This interface is used by the toolkit to access storage in which
 * {@link AAFFile AAF files} are to be read and written.  It is typically 
 * implemented by clients of {@link AAFFile AAF file}.  Note that some 
 * implementations are provided as a convenience to {@link AAFFile AAF
 * file} clients.</p>
 * 
 * <p>When writing to a stream, clients should be aware that the
 * stream's capacity may be limited.  To insure that writes will not
 * fail due to insufficient stream capacity, clients must implement
 * {@link RandomRawStorage} and call
 * {@link RandomRawStorage#setExtent(long)} to pre-allocate capacity 
 * in the stream.  Writes done within the size specified to the most 
 * recent successful {@link RandomRawStorage#setExtent(long)} call are 
 * guaranteed to succeed.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This method assumes that the storage has at least sequential access
 * capability.</p>
