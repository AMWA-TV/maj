 * on a local disk and the body stream identifier for the internal data.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The methods of this interface are statically implemented by the 
 * {@linkplain MediaEngine media engine} to provide a per-virtual-machine
 * stream resolution strategy that is used by default for all properties of
 * {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.meta.TypeDefinitionStream stream type}. The strategy
 * can be replaced by changing the stream resolver used by the media engine
 * by calling {@link MediaEngine#changeStreamResolver(StreamResolver)}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The MAJ API has a default {@linkplain LocalFileResolver local file resolver} 
 * that is used to provide access to streams that are currently accessible as local 
 * files. These are often the same MXF or AAF files that wrap the stream data with 
 * its associated metadata.</p>
