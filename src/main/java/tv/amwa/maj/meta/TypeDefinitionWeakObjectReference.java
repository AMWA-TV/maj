/**
 * <p>Specifies the definition of a property type that 
 * defines an object relationship where the target of the weak reference 
 * is referenced by the object with the property with the 
 * weak object reference type. Only objects that define a unique 
 * identification ({@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.record.AUID AUID} or 
 * {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.record.PackageID PackageID}) can be the targets of weak 
 * object references. In an AAF file, an object can be the target of one or more than one weak 
 * references.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This property type is known as a <em>weak reference</em>. For example, a reference
 * to a {@linkplain DataDefinition data definition} of this type is called a "WeakReference
 * to DataDefinition" in the AAF object specification and may also be represented as
 * "WeakReference&lt;DataDefinition&gt;". Both these styles of type name can be used
 * to return a strong reference type definition from the factory function 
 * {@link tv.amwa.maj.industry.Warehouse#lookForType(String)}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Note that the <em>target list</em> property of a weak object reference type definition is
 * not exposed through this interface. This property will be maintained
 * automatically by the MAJ API.</p>
