<p>Specifications of all the meta-classes of AAF that provides meta-information about classes, properties
and data types. The classes described may be <a href="../model/package-summary.html">AAF interchangeable classes</a>,
extension metadata classes or entirely unrelated. AAF meta-classes are specified in section&nbsp;27 of the
<a href="http://www.amwa.tv/html/specs/aafobjectspec-v1.1.pdf">AAF object
specification v1.1</a>. The root class for
the definition of meta-classes is {@link tv.amwa.maj.meta.MetaDefinition MetaDefinition}, which can also be
serialized to an AAF file used as part of a {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.meta.MetaDictionary meta dictionary}.</p>

<p>The interfaces defined in this package are fundamental to the features of the
<a href="../industry/package-summary.html">industry package</a>, including the runtime
{@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.industry.MediaEngine media engine},
{@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.industry.Warehouse warehouse} and
{@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.industry.Forge forge}.</p>

<h2>Class and property definitions</h2>

<p>Every class is defined by a {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.meta.ClassDefinition class definition} that
includes its position in a class hierarchy (single inheritance), name, identifier and whether it is
concrete or abstract. Class definitions in MAJ are generated automatically by registering a Java class
with the {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.industry.Warehouse warehouse} using the
{@link tv.amwa.maj.industry.Warehouse#lookForClass(Class) lookForClass(Class)} method. The class
must be annotated with the {@link tv.amwa.maj.industry.MediaClass media class annotation}. This
allows dynamic runtime extension of the classes supported.</p>

<p>Classes have properties that are defined by {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.meta.PropertyDefinition property
definitions}. To access the property definitions for a class, use the
{@link tv.amwa.maj.meta.ClassDefinition#getPropertyDefinitions()} and
{@link tv.amwa.maj.meta.ClassDefinition#getAllPropertyDefinitions()} methods. To get the
values of the properties for a given class, call
{@link tv.amwa.maj.meta.ClassDefinition#getProperties(tv.amwa.maj.industry.MetadataObject) getProperties(MetadataObject)},
where the metadata object is the instance to be queried.</p>

<h2>TypeDefinitions</h2>

<p>Every property has a data type and the supported data types are defined by
{@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.meta.TypeDefinition type definitions}. All type definitions have a
name and identifier. Other parameters are type-specific, with over 150
{@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.industry.TypeDefinitions pre-defined for AAF} and the ability to
{@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.industry.Warehouse#register(tv.amwa.maj.meta.TypeDefinition, String, String) add new type definitions}
to the warehouse.</p>

<p>Every type definition provides methods for mapping from the Java representation of a value to
a form suitable for representation as AAF or MXF. In particular, the
{@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.meta.TypeDefinition#createValue(Object) createValue(Object)} method of
every type definition is used extensively in the factory methods of the
{@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.industry.Forge forge}. The type mappings supported are described in the
documentation for the <a href="../industry/package-summary.html">industry package</a>.</p>

<h2>Property values</h2>

<p>A {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.industry.PropertyValue property value} is a representation of a value
with its type. Many of the methods of the {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.meta.TypeDefinition type definitions}
manipulate property values and will throw a
{@link tv.amwa.maj.exception.IllegalPropertyValueException IllegalPropertyValueException} if an
attempt is made to use the methods for a value of the wrong type.</p>

<h2>Heritage</h2>

<p>In the C-based API, the class, property and type definitions are available in a file called
"<code>AAFMetaDictionary.h</code>". This is extracted from a spreadsheet containing equivalent
information. The same extraction process is used to generate a large number of header files,
such as "<code>AAFProeprtyDefs.h</code>". This approach has been replaced in the MAJ API through
the use of the {@link tv.amwa.maj.industry.MediaClass MediaClass} and
{@link tv.amwa.maj.industry.MediaProperty MediaProperty} annotations. These annotations have
been tested against the same AAF meta dictionary to ensure that they contain the same
values, which is what makes the C-based implementation and the MAJ API interoperable.</p>

<p>Many of the methods of the meta-classes were originally specified for the C-based reference
implementation and have been translated using the
<a href="../model/package-summary.html">same process described for the interchangeable
classes</a>.</p>
