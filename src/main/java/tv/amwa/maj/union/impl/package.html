<p>Implementations of classes used to package up collections of values as an argument to 
a method of the MAJ API. These classes are not themselves persistent objects. Packaging up
property values into classes allows related values to be managed together. This approach 
is useful when:</p>

<ul>
 <li>ensuring conditional rules of the AAF specification are adhered to;
 <li>enabling a method to return a collection of related values.</li>
</ul>

<p>All classes in this package override the {@link java.lang.Object#equals(Object)}, 
{@link java.lang.Object#clone()}, {@link java.lang.Object#toString()} and
{@link java.lang.Object#hashCode()} methods. They are all {@linkplain java.lang.Cloneable
cloneable} and {@linkplain java.lang.Serializable serializable}.</p>

<h2 id="heritage">Heritage</h2>

<p>Many of the classes in this package implement the search criteria specified in the
<a href="../union/package-summary.html">union package</a>. For more information on their heritage, see
<a href="../union/package-summary.html#heritage">the heritage of the union package</a>.</p>

<p>Classes starting with the word <em>multi</em> are used to manage interleaved 
essence and these classes are used as array elements in the method signatures
of {@link tv.amwa.maj.model.EssenceMultiAccess}.</p>

<p>The {@link tv.amwa.maj.argument.Fade Fade} class collects together and manages 
{@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.model.SourceClip source clip} fade properties as a single item.</p>

<p>The {@link tv.amwa.maj.argument.DefaultFade DefaultFade} and {@link tv.amwa.maj.argument.SourceReferenceValue} 
classes implement interfaces specified to ensure rules of the 
<a href="http://www.amwa.tv/html/specs/aafobjectspec-v1.1.pdf">AAF object specification v1.1</a> are met. Similar 
structures were defined in the <a href="http://aaf.sourceforge.net/">existing C-based reference implementation</a>
in file "<code>AAFTypes.h</code>" and used to ensure specified rules are complied with as indicated in the methods
in "<code>AAF.idl</code>".</p>
