/** 
 * <p>Specifies the byte order of a file, such as an AAF file. A ByteOrder property records the byte 
 * order of the computer platform on which the file 
 * was created. Subsequent modification of the file may create objects with foreign byte order; the 
 * byte order of individual modified objects shall be properly maintained by the storage format.</p>
 * 
 * <p>In the {@linkplain #Big big-endian byte order}, the most significant byte is stored 
 * first at the address specified, which is the lowest address of the series of bytes that constitute 
 * the value. In the {@linkplain #Little little-endian byte order}, the least-significant byte 
 * is stored first. In both cases, each individual byte is stored with the most-significant bit first.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Note that the <a href="http://www.amwa.tv/html/specs/aafobjectspec-v1.1.pdf">AAF object 
 * specification v1.1</a> uses an {@link tv.amwa.maj.integer.Int16} value to represent byte order. This
 * value can be retrieved using {@link #getAAFByteOrderCode()} method and converted back to a value of this
 * enumeration using {@link #getByteOrderFromAAFCode(short)}.</p>
