<p>Defines {@linkplain java.lang.Enum Java enumerations} representing the enumerations specified in the AAF object
specification and other enumerations used across the MAJ API. The enumerations in this package have a fixed
number of defined elements, unlike extendible enumerations that can be extended at runtime.</p>

<h2>Enumeration kinds</h2>

<p>Section&nbsp;21.2 of the <a href="http://www.amwa.tv/html/specs/aafobjectspec-v1.1.pdf">AAF object
specification v1.1</a> specifies a number of enumeration data types. Enumerations are made up of a fixed
set of elements with each element represented by a name and an ordinal value. All of these enumerations
are represented in this package by a Java enumeration.</p>

<p>As Java enumerations do not have to have an ordinal
value associated with them, the AAF-specified ordinal value is provided through the
{@link tv.amwa.maj.industry.MediaEnumerationValue MediaEnumerationValue} interface that is implemented by all
enumerations. The ordinal value of an element can be retrieved using the
{@link tv.amwa.maj.industry.MediaEnumerationValue#value() value()} method. Some of the enumerations
also provide a static <code>fromOrdinal(int)</code> method that can be used to return an enumeration element
from its specified ordinal value.</p>

<p>Other enumerations are defined for implementation-specific reasons, such as {@link tv.amwa.maj.enumeration.ByteOrder
ByteOrder}. In general, these enumerations provide a convenient way to configure features the API or refer to property values
in a user-friendly way.</p>

<h2 id="extendibleEnumeration">Extendible enumeration</h2>

<p>Extendible enumeration data types do not have a fixed set of specified elements, although a currently known set
of built-in elements is provided in section&nbsp;23.1 of the
<a href="http://www.amwa.tv/html/specs/aafobjectspec-v1.1.pdf">AAF object specification v1.1</a>. An
extendible enumeration element consists of a name and {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.record.AUID AUID}
unique identifier pair, suitable for the representation of reference data sets. The built-in elements
are defined in the <a href="../constant/package-summary.html">constant
package</a> using the {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.industry.ExtendibleEnumerationItem extendible enumeration annotation}.
Additional elements can be registered with a JVM using the registration methods of the
{@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.industry.Warehouse warehouse}.</p>

<h2>Heritage</h2>

<p>The original versions of the enumerations of this package were derived from the <code>enum</code>
type definitions in the
<a href="http://aaf.sourceforge.net/">existing C-based AAF reference implementation</a>, from file
"<code>AAFTypes.h</code>". A typical source enum definition looks like the code below:</p>

<pre>
    typedef aafInt32 aafContentScanningType_t;
    typedef enum _aafContentScanningType_e
    {
        kAAFContentScanning_NotKnown = 0,
        kAAFContentScanning_Progressive = 1,
        kAAFContentScanning_Interlace = 2,
        kAAFContentScanning_Mixed = 3
    } aafContentScanningType_e;
</pre>

<p>The following steps have been taken to convert the C-based enum type definitions into Java
enumerations, taking advantage of Java's class-based representation of enumerations wherever
possible:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The name of the enumeration has had "<code>aaf</code>" removed from its start and "<code>_e</code>"
 removed from the end. Where the enumeration is specified in the
 <a href="http://www.amwa.tv/html/specs/aafobjectspec-v1.1.pdf">AAF object specification</a> then the
 name has been matched to that. In the example above, the enumeration name becomes "<code>ContentScanningType</code>".</li>

 <li>The characters "<code>kAAF</code>" have been removed from the start of each element name.</li>

 <li>As the name of elements of Java enumerations are scoped by the enumeration they belong to and
 so do not require a globally unique name, any enumeration-specific label used for each element
 name has been removed. This should make code written to use the MAJ API easier to read. In the example
 above, the characters "<code>ContentScanning_</code>" have been
 removed from the element names, for example "<code>Progressive</code>" instead of
 "<code>ContentScanning_Progressive</code>".</li>

 <li>The constant ordinal value associated with each enumeration element has become a value passed
 the the private constructor for each enumeration element. It is then stored within the enumeration
 element ready to be retrieved with a call to the {@link tv.amwa.maj.industry.MediaEnumerationValue#value()
 value()} method.</li>
</ul>

<p>The resulting underlying Java code for the {@linkplain tv.amwa.maj.enumeration.ContentScanningType content
scanning type} is:</p>

<pre>
    public enum ContentScanningType
        implements AAFEnumerationValue {

        NotKnown(0),
        Progressive(1),
        Interlace(2),
        Mixed(3);

        private int value;

        private ContentScanningType(
                int value) {

            this.value = value;
        }

        &#64;Int64 public long value() {

            return (long) value;
        }
    }
</pre>
